# ColorCave
Game where user is able to work their way through a maze by clicking on different-colored doors. Each room is represented by a node and I wrote a BFS algorithm to count the number of steps it takes a robot to find the most optimal path through the maze. Algorithm is able to work on any maze of nodes and can find the best path from a start to end node.
